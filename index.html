		The list of pictures going left to right goes <br>
		<br>
		- Freshly drawn<br>
		- Smudged<br>
		- Getting wet<br>
		- Scrubbed with soap and water<br>
		<br>
		Paint pen is my personal favorite so I will be mostly using that
	</p>
	<h2>Step 2:</h2>
	<h3>Picking what colors to use</h3>
	<p> 
		I have alot less to say about this <br>
		It matters mostly on what you like and your skin tone <br>
		Here is some colors on my skin <br>
	</p>

	<h4>The middle is paint pens and the sides are chalk markers </h4>
	<h2>Step 3:</h2>
	<h3>Starting to draw the sun</h3>
	<p>
		The first step of drawing the sun is finding the center of your hand and drawing a dot<br>
		You can just eyeball it because it doesn't have to be perfect
	</p>
	<img src="dot.jpg">
	<h2>Step 4:</h2>
	<h3>Starting the spiral</h3>
	<p>
		You are to want to start to draw a spiral starting at the dot<br>
		Mine are always counter clockwise but it doesnâ€™t really matter
	</p>
	<img src="Start_spiral.jpg">
	<p>
		I don't have many tips for drawing the spiral other than: Practice and Thicker markers are more forgiving
	</p>
	<h2>Step 5:</h2>
	<h3>Finishing off the spiral</h3>
	<p>
		Finish off the spiral until you are happy with the size<br>
		Don't forget you will still need to draw the lines around it
	</p>
	<img src="Spiral.jpg">
	<p>
		A trick to make it look circler <br>
		Line up the end with the direction the beginning is pointed
	</p>
	<img src="Line_up.jpg">
	<h2>Step 6:</h2>
	<h3>Drawing the lines around the spiral</h3>
	<p>
		For drawing the lines you pick a point and draw a line going out from the spiral
	</p>
	<img src="Line_one.jpg">
	<p>
		Then draw a smaller line next to the previous
	</p>
	<img src="Line_two.jpg">
	<p>
		Continue doing this until the spiral is surrounded 
	</p>
	<img src="Lines_All.jpg">
	<p>
		Now you have finished the spiral sun<br>
		You can also add a ring or bracelet to help frame it<br>
		<br>
		You can do a lot to customize it in tons of different ways to fit your style more<br>
		Here are some examples of customized suns.
